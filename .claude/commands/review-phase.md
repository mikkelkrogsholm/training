- Current git status: !`git status --short`
- Package.json (if exists): !`[ -f package.json ] && cat package.json | head -30`

## Your Task

   - Check for E2E tests if applicable

4. **Best Practices Compliance**
   - Verify canonical units storage (kg, meters, seconds)
   - Check for proper DTO mapping
   - Ensure no raw DB shapes exposed
   - Verify security practices (bcrypt, HTTP-only cookies)

5. **Module System (if applicable)**
   - Check module isolation (no cross-module imports)
   - Verify module.json if module was created
   - Check slot/event registrations
